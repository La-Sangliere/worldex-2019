{
"background": "Settled as early as 1000 B.C., Samoa was not reached by European explorers until the 18th century. International rivalries in the latter half of the 19th century were settled by an 1899 treaty in which Germany and the US divided the Samoan archipelago. The US formally occupied its portion - a smaller group of eastern islands with the excellent harbor of Pago Pago - the following year.",

The fish processing business accounted for 15.5% of employment in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late September 2009, an earthquake and the resulting tsunami devastated American Samoa and nearby Samoa, disrupting transportation and power generation, and resulting in about 200 deaths. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency oversaw a relief program of nearly $25 million. Transfers from the US Government add substantially to American Samoa&#39;s economic well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attempts by the government to develop a larger and broader economy are restrained by Samoa&#39;s remote location, its limited transportation, and its devastating hurricanes. Tourism has some potential as a source of income and jobs.&lt;/p&gt;",
