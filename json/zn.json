"background": "The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the world&#39;s five oceans (followed by the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Southern Ocean, and Arctic Ocean). Strategically important access waterways include the La Perouse, Tsugaru, Tsushima, Taiwan, Singapore, and Torres Straits.The decision by the International Hydrographic Organization in the spring of 2000 to delimit a fifth ocean, the Southern Ocean, removed the portion of the Pacific Ocean south of 60 degrees south.",

"climate": "planetary air pressure systems and resultant wind patterns exhibit remarkable uniformity in the south and east; trade winds and westerly winds are well-developed patterns, modified by seasonal fluctuations; tropical cyclones (hurricanes) may form south of Mexico from June to October and affect Mexico and Central America; continental influences cause climatic uniformity to be much less pronounced in the eastern and western regions at the same latitude in the North Pacific Ocean; the western Pacific is monsoonal - a rainy season occurs during the summer months, when moisture-laden winds blow from the ocean over the land, and a dry season during the winter months, when dry winds blow from the Asian landmass back to the ocean; tropical cyclones (typhoons) may strike southeast and east Asia from May to December",
"terrain": "&lt;p&gt;surface dominated by two large gyres (broad, circular systems of currents), one in the northern Pacific and another in the southern Pacific; in the northern Pacific, sea ice forms in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk in winter; in the southern Pacific, sea ice from Antarctica reaches its northernmost extent in October; the ocean floor in the eastern Pacific is dominated by the East Pacific Rise, while the western Pacific is dissected by deep trenches, including the Mariana Trench, which is the world&#39;s deepest at 10,924 m&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;major surface currents:&lt;/strong&gt; clockwise North Pacific Gyre formed by the warm northward flowing Kuroshio Current in the west, the eastward flowing North Pacific Current in the north, the southward flowing cold California Current in the east, and the westward flowing North Equatorial Current in the south; the counterclockwise South Pacific Gyre composed of the southward flowing warm East Australian Current in the west, the eastward flowing South Pacific Current in the south, the northward flowing cold Peru (Humbolt) Current in the east, and the westward flowing South Equatorial Current in the north&lt;/p&gt;",

"environment_current_issues": "pollution (such as sewage, runoff from land and toxic waste); habitat destruction; over-fishing; climate change leading to sea level rise, ocean acidification, and warming; endangered marine species include the dugong, sea lion, sea otter, seals, turtles, and whales; oil pollution in Philippine Sea and South China Sea",
"geography_note": "the major chokepoints are the Bering Strait, Panama Canal, Luzon Strait, and the Singapore Strait; the Equator divides the Pacific Ocean into the North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean; dotted with low coral islands and rugged volcanic islands in the southwestern Pacific Ocean; much of the Pacific Ocean&#39;s rim lies along the Ring of Fire, a belt of active volcanoes and earthquake epicenters that accounts for up to 90% of the world&#39;s earthquakes and some 75% of the world&#39;s volcanoes",

"economy": 
{
"economy_overview": "The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the world economy and particularly to those nations its waters directly touch. It provides low-cost sea transportation between East and West, extensive fishing grounds, offshore oil and gas fields, minerals, and sand and gravel for the construction industry. In 1996, over 60% of the world&#39;s fish catch came from the Pacific Ocean. Exploitation of offshore oil and gas reserves is playing an ever-increasing role in the energy supplies of the US, Australia, NZ, China, and Peru. The high cost of recovering offshore oil and gas, combined with the wide swings in world prices for oil since 1985, has led to fluctuations in new drillings.",
"marine_fisheries": "&lt;p&gt;the Pacific Ocean fisheries are the most important in the world accounting for 59%, or 46,706,536 mt, of the global marine capture in 2016; of the six regions delineated by the Food and Agriculture Organization in the Pacific Ocean, the following are the most important:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Northwest Pacific&lt;/em&gt; region (Region 61) is the world&amp;rsquo;s most important fishery producing 28% of the global catch or 22,411,224 mt in 2016; it encompasses the waters north of 20&amp;ordm; north latitude and west of 175&amp;ordm; west longitude with the major producers including China (14,776,769 mt), Japan (2,896,073 mt), South Korea (944,558 mt), and Taiwan (378,990 mt); the principal catches include Alaska Pollock, Japanese anchovy, chub mackerel, and scads&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Western Central Pacific&lt;/em&gt; region (Region 71) is the world&amp;rsquo;s second most important fishing region producing 16%, or 12,742,955 mt, of the global catch in 2016; tuna is the most important species in this region; the region includes the waters between 20&amp;ordm; North and 25&amp;ordm; South latitude and west of 175&amp;ordm; West longitude with the major producers including Indonesia (4,704,382 mt), Vietnam (2,678,406 mt), Philippines (1,865,213 mt), Thailand (950,219 mt), and Malaysia (792,163 mt); the principal catches include Skipjack and Yellowfin tuna, sardinellas, and cephalopods&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Southeast Pacific &lt;/em&gt;region (Region 87) is the third major Pacific fishery and fifth largest in the world producing 8%, or 6,329,328 mt, of the global catch in 2016; this region includes the nutrient rich upwelling waters off the west coast of South America between 5&amp;ordm; North and 60&amp;ordm; South latitude and east of 120&amp;ordm; West longitude with the major producers including Peru (3,774,887 mt), Chile (1,495,359 mt), and Ecuador (612,755 mt); the principal catches include Peruvian anchovy (50% of the catch), Jumbo flying squid, and Chilean jack mackerel&lt;/p&gt; &lt;em&gt;Pacific Northeast&lt;/em&gt; region (Region 67) is the fourth largest Pacific Ocean fishery and eighth largest in the world producing 4% of the global catch or 3,092,529 mt in 2016; this region encompasses the waters north of 40&amp;ordm; North latitude and east of 175&amp;ordm; West longitude including the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea with the major producers including the US (2,900,835 mt), Canada (180,664 mt), and Russia (11,030 mt); the principal catches include Alaska pollock, Pacific cod, and North Pacific hake",
