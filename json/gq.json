Of that total, federal grants and cover-over payments amounted to $3444.1 million in 2016, or 35.8% of Guamâ€™s total revenues for the fiscal year. In 2016, Guamâ€™s economy grew 0.3%. Despite slow growth, Guamâ€™s economy has been stable over the last decade. National defense spending cushions the islandâ€™s economy against fluctuations in tourism. Service exports, mainly spending by foreign tourists in Guam, amounted to over $1 billion for the first time in 2016, or 17.8% of GDP.",
